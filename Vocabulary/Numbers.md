-  In [[toki pona]] the official **number system** is very limited. The folllowing **numerals** are in [[toki pona]]:

| [[Words\|word]] | value |
| :-------------: | :---: |
|       ala       |   0   |
|       wan       |   1   |
|       tu        |   2   |
|      luka       |   5   |
|      mute       |  20   |
|       ale       |  100  |
- [[Words]] are added or repeated in order to form **numbers**
- **42** = *mute mute tu* (**20+20+2**) 
- **18** = *luka luka luka tu wan* (**5+5+5+2+1**)
-  An alternative system could be that *mute* = **3** and each [[Words|word]] would be a **digit** in a base **4** system
- **31** = *wan mute mute*
