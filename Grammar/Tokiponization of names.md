Since the [[Toki pona|toki pona]] alphabet consists of only 14 [[Phonology|letters]], and it has strict rules in [[Words|words]] and [[Syllables|syllables]], you have to replace [[Phonology#Consonants|consonants]] in names. These are only suggestions, it depends also on the pronounciation in the original language.
- *f*, *b* -> *p*
- *d* -> *t*
- *g* -> *k*
- *c*, *z* -> *s*
- *v*  -> *w*
- *r* -> *l* or *w*

When two [[Phonology#Consonants|consonants]] are next to each other (and it does'nt respect [[Toki pona|toki pona]] rules of [[Words|words]] and [[Syllables|syllables]]) such as in words *France* you can:
- Drop the [[Phonology#Consonants|consonants]] so that the number of [[Syllables|syllables]] is preserved: *Panse*
- Inserting [[Phonology#Vowels|vowels]] (it's up to you what [[Phonology#Vowels|vowels]] you use) *Palanse* 
Names of languages and countries are in from the countries language (German is *toki Tosi* (from Deutsch)). If the names are related, the name of the country is the same (Germany is *ma Tosi* not *Tosilan*).
