- Since the [[Toki pona|toki pona]] alphabet consists of only 14 [[Phonology|letters]], and it has strict rules in [[Words|words]] and [[Syllables|syllables]], you have to replace [[Phonology#Consonants|consonants]] in names
	- *f*, *b* -> *p*
	- *d* -> *t*
	- *g* -> *k*
	- *c*, *z* -> *s*
	- *v*  -> *w*
	- *r* -> *l* or *w*
	 *(These are only suggestions, it depends also on the pronounciation in the original language)*
- When two [[Phonology#Consonants|consonants]] are next to each other (and it doesn't respect [[Toki pona|toki pona]] rules of [[Words|words]] and [[Syllables|syllables]]) such as in words *France* you can:
	1. Drop the [[Phonology#Consonants|consonants]] so that the number of [[Syllables|syllables]] is preserved - *Panse*
	2. Insert [[Phonology#Vowels|vowels]] (it's up to you what [[Phonology#Vowels|vowels]] you use) - *Palanse* 
- Names of languages and countries are in from the countries language - German is *toki Tosi* (from Deutsch) 
- If the name of the countries language is derived from the countries name, the countries  - Germany is *ma Tosi* not *Tosilan*
