>If English is a thick novel **toki pona** is a haiku --- jan Sonja
- Has less than 200 words
- For more complex words you have to be creative (jan pona - good person can be said instead of friend)
- Means "good language" (see [[Vocabulary]])
- Only names are capitalized (no capital letters at start of the [[Sentence format|sentece]])
- To denote a verb you say [[Li|li]] before the word
- [[Pronouns]] are genderless
- Words like pona or ike mean good/bad **subjectively to the speaker**
- Since names are like adjectives, you have to put something in front of them (jan before names, ma before countries etc.)
- **[[Tokiponization of names]]** is often neccessary due to **toki pona** having only 14 [[Phonology|letters]]
